**A serious vulnerability in the Linux glibc library. It allows attackers to remotely take complete control of the victim system without having any prior knowledge of system credentials.**

During a code audit Qualys researchers discovered a buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of glibc. This bug can be triggered both locally and remotely via all the gethostbyname*() functions. Applications have access to the DNS resolver primarily through the gethostbyname*() set of functions. These functions convert a hostname into an IP address.

This is for the Debian :)
