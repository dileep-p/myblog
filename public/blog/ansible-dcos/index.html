<h2 id="why-dcos">Why dc/os?</h2>
<p><em>DC/OS is based on the production proven Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel, combining years of real-life experience with best practices for building and running modern applications in production.</em></p>
<p><em>Build modern apps using state of the art technologies such as containers and big data services, and confidently move from development to production.</em></p>
<p><em>You can learn more about dc/os from <a href="https://github.com/dcos">here</a></em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>At VimpelCom we are embarking on the journey of transformation and intend to become one of the pioneers of digital disruption.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Most of our microservice applications are running on containers and container orchestration is pretty easy with dc/os. You can also use other tools like docker-swarm, Kubernetes etc for this purpose however there are some apps which are not running in containers &amp; connected to some microservice container applications. So we need way to provide HA, reliability and scalability for those apps as well.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>We used AWS for our development/staging environments. Our testing &amp; production env are running on-premises due to data compliance policies.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>dc/os provides Cloudformation templates to create the setup in AWS.</em> <a href="https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/aws.html?_ga=1.118161932.488990590.1483648358">Click here to see the cloudformation template</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>However we cannot use this Cloudformation template for our purpose because our production is running on-premises. So we created an Ansible playbook which can be used in AWS as well as on-premises.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I am not sharing the original source code in here however I am open sourcing a simple ansible playbook which can be used for both in AWS as well as in Datacenter</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>In order to use this playbook for on-premises, you may need to change some env variables and few alternations which is pretty easy if you're familiar with Ansible.</em></p></li>
